By accessing or using the services provided by \[Your Company Name] ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"), including any content, functionality, transactions, or services available via our domain (\[yourdomain.com]), subdomains, APIs, and associated mobile or desktop applications (collectively, the "Platform"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these Terms, you may not use our Platform.

Our operations are compliant with GDPR (EU Regulation 2016/679), CCPA/CPRA, PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and applicable eCommerce laws in the US, EU, and other jurisdictions. You are responsible for complying with your local laws, including consumer protection, export control, and sanctions laws.

**3. User Eligibility and Identity Verification**
Users must be 18+ years old or meet the age of majority in their jurisdiction. We reserve the right to conduct enhanced due diligence (KYC/KYB) in cases of high-value transactions, flagged behavior, or business account registration. Identity verification data is encrypted and stored in secure environments.

**4. Account Security, Credentials, and 2FA**
All users must use strong passwords. We support multi-factor authentication (2FA) for account access. Users must notify us immediately of suspicious activities. We employ credential hashing (bcrypt with salting) and token-based session expiration policies.

**5. Orders, Transactions, and Dynamic Risk Scoring**
All transactions are processed via encrypted payment gateways using TLS 1.3 and SHA-256 integrity checks. Payment data is handled solely by compliant third parties (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Adyen). Orders may be subject to risk-scoring via behavioral analytics, fraud databases, and heuristic algorithms.

**6. Encryption, Secure Processing & Data Residency**
Data is encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Sensitive keys are stored in HSMs. We maintain geo-redundant backups and follow least-privilege access control. Data residency for EU users is guaranteed in EU-based data centers.

**7. Advanced Shipping, Insurance, and Supply Chain Disclosure**
We partner with insured logistics providers. Tracking data is updated in real-time and verified against hash-verified manifests. Any delay, force majeure, or customs intervention is documented and visible to users.

**8. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration & Class Action Waiver**
Disputes must be resolved through binding arbitration under the UNCITRAL or JAMS rules. All proceedings will be confidential. Class actions and jury trials are waived. A 30-day mediation period precedes formal proceedings.

**9. AI-Based Content Moderation & Transaction Analysis**
We reserve the right to apply AI/ML-based moderation, fraud detection, and product eligibility enforcement. You consent to such automated decision-making under GDPR Article 22, with the right to human appeal.

**10. Limitation of Liability & SLA Exception Handling**
\[Your Company Name] is not liable for incidental, consequential, indirect, or punitive damages exceeding the aggregate amount paid by the user in the last twelve (12) months. Downtime is governed by a 99.99% SLA with logged incident reports.
